# AngularTutorial
Went through Angular "homes-app" tutorial via YouTube (https://youtu.be/xAT0lHYhHMY), referring to the (outdated) tutorial web pages at https://angular.dev/tutorials/first-app.

# Angular Homes App
- Install Angular if you don't have it installed

  `npm install -g @angular/cli`

- Clone this branch to your local machine

  `git clone -b homes-app-start git@github.com:angular/codelabs.git homes-app`

- Once the code has been downloaded

  `cd homes-app`

- Install the depencies

  `npm install` 

- Run the application 

  `ng serve`
